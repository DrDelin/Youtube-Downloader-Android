  4. Thats all! Your video / audio / playlist will download (Location: Internal storage of your device -> Termux-Downloader)
  5. (For Youtube Download) Select Video / audio / best -> Select required resolution once, later it is set as default (can be changed if you type "y") -> skip next (unless if you want custom format) -> type "y" if you need subtitle(Subtitle only available if only youtube has..) -> Forget rest!... My script will take care
  6. (For Youtube Music / audio from youtube) Type your favourite audio codec (like mp3, m4a, aac, webm, flac...) for one time as default (can be changed later) -> Audio will be downloaded in your favourite codec
